<Exercise 1>
What is the median of the points column in the reviews DataFrame?

****************
median_points = reviews.points.median()

# Check your answer
q1.check()

Correct

q1.hint()
q1.solution()

Hint:
Use the median function (a built-in pandas function, like the mean function or the unique function).

Solution:
median_points = reviews.points.median()
****************

<Exercise 2>
What countries are represented in the dataset? (Your answer should not include any duplicates)

****************
countries = reviews.country.unique()

# Check your answer
q2.check()

Hint:
Use the unique function to get a list of unique entries in a column.

Solution:
countries = reviews.country.unique()
****************

<Exercise 3>
How often does each country appear in the dataset? Create a Series reviews_per_country mapping countries to the count of reviews of wines from that country.

****************
reviews_per_country = reviews.country.value_counts()

# Check your answer
q3.check()

Correct

q3.hint()
q3.solution()

Hint:
To see a list of unique values and how often they occur in a Series, use the value_counts method.

Solution:
reviews_per_country = reviews.country.value_counts()
****************

<Exercise 4>
Create variable centered_price containing a version of the price column with the mean price subtracted.
(Note: This 'centering' transformation is a common preprocessing step before applying various machine learning algorithms)

****************
centered_price = reviews.price - reviews.price.mean()

# Check your answer
q4.check()

Correct

q4.hint()
q4.solution()

Hint:
To get the mean of a column in a Pandas DataFrame, use the mean function.

Solution:
centered_price = reviews.price - reviews.price.mean()
****************

<Exercise 5>
I'm an economical wine buyer. Which wine is the "best bargain"? Create a variable bargain_wine with the title of the wine with the highest points-to-price ratio in the
dataset.

****************
bargain_idx = (reviews.points / reviews.price).idxmax()
bargain_wine = reviews.loc[bargain_idx, 'title']
​
# Check your answer
q5.check()

Correct

q5.hint()
q5.solution()

Hint:
The idxmax method may be useful here.

Solution:
bargain_idx = (reviews.points / reviews.price).idxmax()
bargain_wine = reviews.loc[bargain_idx, 'title']
****************

<Exercise 6>
There are only so many words you can use when describing a bottle of wine. Is a wine more likely to be "tropical" or "fruity"? Create a Series descriptor_counts counting
how many times each of these two words appears in the description column in the dataset. (For simplicity, let's ignore the capitalized versions of these words.)

****************
n_trop = reviews.description.map(lambda desc: "tropical" in desc).sum()
n_fruity = reviews.description.map(lambda desc: "fruity" in desc).sum()
descriptor_counts = pd.Series([n_trop, n_fruity], index=['tropical', 'fruity'])

# Check your answer
q6.check()

Correct

q6.hint()
q6.solution()

Hint:
Use a map to check each description for the string tropical, then count up the number of times this is True. Repeat this for fruity. Finally, create a Series
combining the two values.

Solution:
n_trop = reviews.description.map(lambda desc: "tropical" in desc).sum()
n_fruity = reviews.description.map(lambda desc: "fruity" in desc).sum()
descriptor_counts = pd.Series([n_trop, n_fruity], index=['tropical', 'fruity'])
****************

<Exercise 7>
We'd like to host these wine reviews on our website, but a rating system ranging from 80 to 100 points is too hard to understand - we'd like to translate them into simple
star ratings. A score of 95 or higher counts as 3 stars, a score of at least 85 but less than 95 is 2 stars. Any other score is 1 star.

Also, the Canadian Vintners Association bought a lot of ads on the site, so any wines from Canada should automatically get 3 stars, regardless of points.
Create a series star_ratings with the number of stars corresponding to each review in the dataset.

****************
def stars(row):
    if row.country == 'Canada':
        return 3
    elif row.points >= 95:
        return 3
    elif row.points >= 82:
        return 2
    else:
        return 1

star_ratings = reviews.apply(stars, axis='columns')

# Check your answer
q7.check()

Correct

q7.hint()
q7.solution()

Hint:
Begin by writing a custom function that accepts a row from the DataFrame as input and returns the star rating corresponding to the row. Then, use DataFrame.apply to apply
the custom function to every row in the dataset.

Solution:
def stars(row):
    if row.country == 'Canada':
        return 3
    elif row.points >= 95:
        return 3
    elif row.points >= 85:
        return 2
    else:
        return 1

star_ratings = reviews.apply(stars, axis='columns')
